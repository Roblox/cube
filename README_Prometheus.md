# Cube: AI-Powered 3D Asset Generation through Advanced Generative Intelligence

## Project Overview

Cube is an innovative generative AI system for 3D asset creation, developed by Roblox's Foundation AI Team. It represents a groundbreaking approach to 3D intelligence, focusing on empowering developers and creators to generate high-quality 3D assets through advanced machine learning techniques.

### Core Purpose

The primary goal of Cube is to build a foundation model that can support comprehensive 3D asset generation, enabling developers to create complex 3D objects, scenes, and interactive elements with simple text prompts. It aims to democratize 3D content creation by reducing the technical barriers traditionally associated with 3D modeling.

### Key Features

- **Text-to-Shape Generation**: Convert natural language descriptions into detailed 3D mesh models
- **Shape Tokenization**: Advanced algorithm for representing and reconstructing 3D geometries
- **High-Quality Asset Creation**: Generate intricate 3D objects with fine-grained detail
- **Flexible Generation**: Support for various object types, from characters to props and scenes
- **Low-Barrier Entry**: Intuitive text-based interface for 3D asset creation

### Technical Innovations

The system comprises two primary components:
- A sophisticated shape tokenizer that converts 3D geometries into discrete token representations
- A powerful text-to-shape generation model that can create 3D assets from textual descriptions

By providing an accessible, AI-powered approach to 3D asset generation, Cube represents a significant step towards more democratized and efficient 3D content creation for developers, designers, and creators.
